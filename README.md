# React Native application: 
  - A mobile game where you vote on provided
    prompts with friends.
  - Users select the player Most likely and
    Least Likely to do/be whatever the prompt suggests.
  - At the end, the votes are tallied and the
    nominees with the most votes are given their award!
  - Want to find out how your friends really
    think of you? Select the Reveal option which allows you to see just who did the voting for who.
# The game includes:
  - Private play sorted by
  generated room codes
  - A timed play session
  - Three rounds, multiple prompts at a time
  - The choice between three separate game
    packs (where the prompts are sorted in family, friends, and Aults Only categories)
  - The ability to add your own prompts to
    make the game for personal for the players
  - And the option to reveal the voters and
    expose their true opinions to the room!
